This is supposed to be a short and simple explanation to avoid a serious problem you had 10/22/2014, for a REAL explanation about decimal - hex conversion and vice-versa, google it!

You tried getting the pop cap to 160,000 so that a 16 player game would grant all players 10K minimum pop cap. You kept reading stuff online like "the hex value you get from the conversion must be written reversed, from right to left, not the way it is converted!" and similar stuffs. So you thought since 160,000 in hex is 27100, that you had to enter 10 02 70, but that didn't work, neither did entering 00 17 20 and many MANY others! So you eventually checked your 15 million pop cap mod and found that 15 million in hex is e4e1c0, which in your actual modded dbworld.dat file was C0 E1 E4, so you thought you did it wrong. You then entered 00 17 20, but that didn't work. Then you got it! You remembered "In hex, single digit values aren't like 1, 2, 3, etc. they are 01, 02, 03, etc!" You then changed it to 00 17 02 and BAM! IT WORKS!

I hope this wasn't too confusing, all I am trying to say is MAKE SURE ALL single digit values have a 0 in front of them! 2 is NOT 2 in hex! 2 is ->02<-!! Here's to hoping you don't waste 2 hours ever again!!!
