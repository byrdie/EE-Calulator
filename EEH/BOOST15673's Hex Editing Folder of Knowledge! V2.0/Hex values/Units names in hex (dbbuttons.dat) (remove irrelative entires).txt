These names listed here are only if you might not find them if you search for their actual name. Per se, you search for "Medic - Atomic" but find nothing. There are scenario editor only units listed here also. Art of Conquest Expansion is needed if you are wondering "What are these weird units listed here I never heard of before?!"

Use EE Unit if you are having a hard time finding a unit's name in hex and it's not listed here. It lists the units by Epoch and in their hex names, so for example under the word "Epoch Stone" it would list all technologies, units, buildings, etc. that are in the Stone Age, then comes "Epoch Copper" and it does the same, so on for every epoch. Thus it is SIMPLE to find the required hex name! At least for dbobjects.dat/dbtechtree.dat!
