Keep in mind my highlighted values ONLY depict the length of that unit's value. For example, the Sea King II's attack value has two values highlighted yes? DO NOT think this is the length of the attack value in general! You can use the to "00 00"s next to them as well, meaning the FULL amount of reserved values for attack for Sea King II reads out as "DB 01 00 00". Keep this in mind for values. Some of them are have only one changeable value, some two, some four like the attack value, some more! I will do my best to detail all values and lengths as good as possible, if not in the screenshots, then in text documents like here!

For example the Range value by the Trench Mortar is "20 41", that is (as far as I personally know) THE FULL AMOUNT, there really seem to be only two values there to mess around with!
