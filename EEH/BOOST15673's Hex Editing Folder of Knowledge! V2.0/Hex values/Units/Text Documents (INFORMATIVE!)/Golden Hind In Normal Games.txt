You want the Golden Hind to be activated in normal games aka random map games also? Hate it being a scenario editor only unit? READ ON THEN! :)

Follow the guide here that JCGF posted:

If the topic is not available anymore and you are using BOOST15673's computer, then check out the microsoft word document "200864222055 (NOT from BOOST15673).doc". Either way, follow the guide exactly!
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

You will need to check the "Golden Hind Various Values.jpg" along with this guide to fully understand how to do this.

The Golden Hind's "Editor Only Value" (as required in step 2) is from the four "01 01 01 01" towards the bottom of it's hex section is the SECOND "01".

The Dock's number (as required in step 3) is "24 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 24"

SKIP STEP 5, the "Button Number" is NOT THERE! It is just "FF FF FF FF" meaning placeholder, useless, no effect, etc.

The Golden Hind's "Tech ID Number" (as required in step 6) is "A6 05 00 00"

The Dock's name is "b  Dock" in hex editors, just search that and you will find it right away.

The Dock's "Number of objects this unit may create" is "52" (as required in step 8), and that is at hex offset "11718", or depending on the hex editor you're using (I used HxD), simply put, hex offset "11710" and hex row 08. I hope you find it!

Now for step 9. At the bottom of the Dock's "Hex Section" thingy, you should see 52 values, which after the fifty-second value, you will see A LOT of "FF FF FF FF" right? These FF's are as stated, placeholders, and in this case end the Dock's section, below all of the FF's you can see "b  House" meaning that this proves that these FF's are the "wall" separating the two things. Anyways, the 52 values at the end of the Dock's section that end in FF's are all the Tech ID's of ALL objects that the Dock can make throughout the entire course of Epochs it's available. Everything from War Rafts - Nexus Carriers. As long as you haven't added any values, the last value before the FF's SHOULD be "89 2E 00 00" right? If this is true then add the Golden Hind's Tech ID Value below it "A6 05 00 00". DO NOT do it the way you think, though! What I mean is on the row below it, meaning put the "A6 05 00 00" DIRECTLY below the value "2A 33 00 00"!! 

Save it, load the game, and BAM! You will notice, however, when the Dock is built in any age, that the Golden Hind appears. Why? It's because the Start Epoch is Prehistoric Age, and the end is Space Age. Also, it covers the button "Place Rally Point (I)" with it's own thumbnail. We must fix this. Now you will NOT be following this guide, but instead MY words ok?:

1. - We must change the Epochs it's available in. Seeing as it uses Cannons, let's make it go from Renaissance - Industrial Ages. That is then in the logically correct class of ships in EE. Now, you see in the picture "00 00 00 00 0F" right? EE likes to subtract the number of the Epoch requirements in hex, that is why they look this way. So for example "04 00 00 00 0A" would mean it goes from the Dark Age to WW2 because in hex, 5 = 05 and 11 = 0B. Thanks to EE subtracting it by one when defining the start and end epochs, it would be defined as "04 00 00 00 0A", although I don't know what the three "00 00 00" in between are for, probably just separation purposes or something. Now, The value for the Golden Hind is as stated "00 00 00 00 0F", meaning it runs from the Prehistoric Age to Space Age. Ending in the Space Age would require the value to be 0E, not 0F, 0F means the object never ends, like Temples, Barracks, Settlements, etc. Now what do we do to make the Golden Hind run from Renaissance - Industrial Ages? If you guessed to change the values to "06 00 00 00 08" then you're absolutely right!! Do this, save it, then check the Dock that you built in the Stone Age. Now the Golden Hind should be gone, and it's thumbnail should no longer be covering the one from the "Place Rally Point (I)" right? If not then redo this, you messed something up...

1. - Changing the unit's start and end epochs are with the knowledge of writing this text document completely impossible! If you change the proper values as stated in the picture, that will NOT change it in game! The Golden Hind will STILL be buildable in the default epochs... BUT! There is a trick. I hate to say it, and you may hate to hear it, but you must REPLACE a unit that has the epochs you want. Seeing as I would like the Golden Hind to go from Renaissance - Industrial Age. I must replace the Galleon - Renaissance with it. How so? Simple! Find the "Position of button on interface" value for the Galleon - Renaissance, that is "07" return to the Golden Hind's section. Check out my picture, see the green highlighted "FF"? Replace it with the Galleon - Renaissance's button value, "07". DONE! 

There is one minimal side effect. IF you have built Galleys before reaching the Renaissance, and then upgrade them in the Renaissance, the Galleys will be upgraded, although any futher Galleys or in this case Galleons, will be Golden Hinds! Same goes for Imperial & Industrial Ages. Upgrading Galleons will upgrade left over ones no problem, but building new ones will be Golden Hinds, and also, Golden Hinds will not be changed if you select the option to upgrade a Galleon. They will remain Golden Hinds throughout these three epochs no matter what! Also, interestingly enough, it will change the name to "Golden Hind" in the build menu, although retain the cost from the Galleons of their ages, including their upgrade costs, same goes for upgrade and build speeds. This is although no biggie, just a bit, well ok actually very odd hehe. If you're a fan of the Golden Hind like I, then ENJOY IT!! You're welcome! :)

2. - Now, sadly the only way I know of changing the thumbnails of the three Galleons to that of the Golden Hind results in nothing good... It literally messes something up and makes the thumbnail completely VANISH in game! This means that you cannot build it because it is not clickable... But if you think you can fix what I know, then read on. WARNING! If you are unsure how to reverse the effect or too lazy to backup your files, DO NOT read on!:

We must change the thumbnail so we don't get confused, even though I doubt that'll happen. Now what you must do is find the "Button ID", this is what defines what picture is shown in the build menu, this is what every unit, building, technology, etc. has. If it doesn't have it then the game will crash because it is trying to load something that doesn't exist aka the infamous "Error 404" haha. The Golden Hind's is "8F 04" as seen in the picture. Now we have to find the ones from the Galleon - Renaissance, Galleon - Imperial, Galleon - Royal. In the hex editor, they will be called "s07 Explosive Galleon", "s08 Super Explosive Galleon", "s09 Explosive Victory". Why so? Nobody knows, every developer/company has different reasons for the names in hex... The Button ID for the three in order are "56 03", "57 03", "58 03". Change them all to the Golden Hind's "8F 04".

3. - Now I have a different, yet surefired way of replacing the thumbnails. Remember how the Golden Hind's button thumbnail was covering the "Place Rally Point (I)" button thumbnail? Now it's time we fixed this! Now, you will require a program called "EE Studio". Once you get it, read on:

Select "SSA Extract", and like in the very old days, manually type in the path to the "data.ssa" file. You must do this for both the original EE and the expansion pack. Then after that you type in the destination to extract it to, BUT! I would HIGHLY suggest making a new folder for this unless you want THOUSANDS of files in your directory unordered!! After the extracting's done, return to EE Studio and select "DLC Decompressor", in the "Input File", go to where Empire Earth is installed, NOT The Art of Conquest! Go into the extracted data.ssa folder wherever you put it, into "textures", and select "Textures (*.sst)" from the "File Type" menu. Search for "act_rallypoint.sst", open it. In "Output File", choose anywhere EXCEPT the folder where you found the "act_rallypoint.sst" in!! This is to avoid overwriting the file in case you need the original back for whatever reason. Click on "Decompress", once it's done, in the EE Studio menu, click on "Textures(SST)", then on "Open(SST File)", and choose the "act_rallypoint.sst" you just decompressed. Now choose "Save(SST to TGA)" and name it whatever you want but NOT the same as the .sst file!! Repeat this process for the Golden Hind's button which is "but_golden hind_07.sst". Now, select "Open(SST File)" again and open the Golden Hind's .sst file. You will see it appear in the black preview space area. Now, select "Convert(TGA to SST)" and select the TGA file that is the Place Rally Point button, the uncompressed "act_rallypoint.sst". Hopefully you know what you named it to when converting it to TGA format! When you open it, another window will open asking you to save the new file. The way I did it was I named mine "but_golden hindd_07.sst", in order to not overwrite anything and mess up accidentally. After you saved it, you will see in the black preview area that the Golden Hind's button was replaced with the Rally Point's button providing you did everything right. Congratulations! Now go into you Art of Conquest's directory, NOT Empire Earth's! Data/textures, place the file in there, as stated, I put my file in there that was called "but_golden hindd_07.sst". Then rename it to the real file name being "but_golden hind_07.sst". Open your game, and BAM! This is however a lazy yet easy way to fix this glitch. Only side effect is that the Place Rally Point button has no clicking animation, you know, the "pushed button" thing? That is missing, but besides that everything's fine! This was only used instead of hex editing because I couldn't find the "Place Rally Point" anywhere in order to swap the button thumbnails, oh well this works just as good don't it?!

REMEMBER! Don't make the mistake I did with the Tech ID, it CAN be confusing to find it! I found two values "C8 00 00 00", "63 02 00 00" and tried using them, which resulted in the game always crashing when building a dock. Furthermore, on a more important note, I was stupid because I only added the values "C8 00" or "63 02", I FORGOT the extra two "00 00"!!
