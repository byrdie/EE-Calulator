Check the B-2 Bomber's folder, you will see two pics, one for the "Stealth mode", and another for "Min. stealth radius". BOTH must be done properly in order for stealth to work!! For example, enable a unit to be stealth, and it will be invincible, however if you add the min. stealth radius additionally, it will be like the Sniper, visible within range of predefined tiles (For example if the min. stealth range is "05 00 00 00", that means when you're 5 tiles or less away from the stealth unit, it will be visible and attackable!).
