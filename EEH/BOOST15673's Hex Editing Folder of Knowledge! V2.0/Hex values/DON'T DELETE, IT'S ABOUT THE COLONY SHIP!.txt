Compare the Colony Ship & Pegasus Transport for various values. You did that to achieve your "99% fully functional" Colony Ship, you did it to find that ONE "00" that must be changed to "01"! You MIGHT be able to find out what is causing the undefined error and make it fully buildable now! GET TO WORK NOW! :) Simply open the dbobjects.dat file in your EE AOC, and then also the one on the desktop, the one on the desktop should be for the Pegasus Transport and the one in EE AOC for the COlony Ship, be careful to not accidentally edit the one on the desktop, I'M WARNING YOU MAN!

UPDATE 6/5/2014: You compared ALL values and tested ALL values that weren't the same, basically, you did what is stated above. You did this in dbobjects.dat & dbtechtree.dat to no avail. The Colony Ship is still only 99% buildable :(
